# Comparing-network-embedding-algorithms-

The project aims to predict the link between the Drug and a Gene. 
The Drug-Gene dataset is the SNAP dataset. The Drugs are all the certified drugs in circulation in the USA.


## Motivation
Motivation behind the topic is to help the physician prescribe personal medicine to the patient.
Drugs have a side-effect on the person if there is link present between the Drug and Gene.

## Method

Aim is to compare different models of Graph visualization techniques and compare the results.

Datasets used are:-
1. ChG-Decagon
2. ChG-Miner
